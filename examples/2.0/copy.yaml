# "copy" is a convenience feature that works like a YAML copy-and-merge
# It is available for both node templates and relationship templates
# The YAML is copied from the source to the target *before* applying the changes
# Note that during the merge of values lists are replaced, not appended to
# This can happen recursively,
# though Puccini does make sure to report a problem if you are copying in a loop
