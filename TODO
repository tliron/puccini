How TOSCA Compilation Works
===========================

1. Use Compris to resolve the source into TOSCA entity structs
   These never change
2. Process Imports (with caching)
3. Return Vec<File>
4. Create the Catalog:
  1. Iterate Types from Files into a namespace and hierarchy
     During this phase we check for cyclical hierarchy errors
  3. Derive Types from parents
     During this phase we check for derivation errors
  3. Iterate Templates from ServiceTemplate into a namespace and connect to their Type
  4. Entype Templates (apply their Type)
     During this phase we check for refinement errors
     E.g. undeclared and required
5. Iterate all derived Types and entyped Templates
   ServiceTemplate -> floria::NodeTemplate
     NodeTemplate -> floria::NodeTemplate
      CapabilityDefinition -> floria::NodeTemplate
      RequirementDefinition -> floria::RelationshipTemplate

$and, $or, etc. functions should be able to have a single argument
