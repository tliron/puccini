  However, this document itself may not be modified in any way, including by removing the copyright
  notice or references to OASIS, except as needed for the purpose of developing any document or

  OASIS requests that any OASIS Party or any other party that believes it has patent claims that
  would necessarily be infringed by implementations of this OASIS Committee Specification or OASIS
  Standard, to notify OASIS TC Administrator and provide an indication of its willingness to grant
  patent licenses to such patent claims in a manner consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS
  Technical Committee that produced this specification.

  OASIS invites any party to contact the OASIS TC Administrator if it is aware of a claim of
  ownership of any patent claims that would necessarily be infringed by implementations of this
  specification by a patent holder that is not willing to provide a license to such patent claims in
  a manner consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS Technical Committee that produced this
  specification. OASIS may include such claims on its website, but disclaims any obligation to do
  so.

  OASIS takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any intellectual property or other
  rights that might be claimed to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described
  in this document or the extent to which any license under such rights might or might not be
  available; neither does it represent that it has made any effort to identify any such rights.
  Information on OASIS' procedures with respect to rights in any document or deliverable produced by
  an OASIS Technical Committee can be found on the OASIS website. Copies of claims of rights made
  available for publication and any assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an
  attempt made to obtain a general license or permission for the use of such proprietary rights by
  implementers or users of this OASIS Committee Specification or OASIS Standard, can be obtained
  from the OASIS TC Administrator. OASIS makes no representation that any information or list of
  intellectual property rights will at any time be complete, or that any claims in such list are, in
  fact, Essential Claims.
